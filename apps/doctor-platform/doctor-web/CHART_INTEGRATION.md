# Chart Integration - Patient-Specific Analysis

## Overview

The symptom tracking chart has been properly integrated into the Dashboard Details page (`/dashboard/details`) for patient-specific analysis. The chart functionality is now contextual and works with the patient selection from the main dashboard.

## How It Works

### 1. **Patient Selection Flow**
1. User clicks on any patient card in the main dashboard (`/dashboard`)
2. Navigation occurs to `/dashboard/details` with patient ID passed via router state
3. Dashboard Details page shows patient-specific information and analysis

### 2. **Chart Integration Features**

#### **Interactive Controls:**
- **Date Range Picker**: Filter symptom data by specific time periods
- **Symptom Multi-Select**: Choose which symptoms to visualize (Fever, Pain)
- **Severity Range Slider**: Filter by symptom severity levels (0-4)

#### **Real-time Filtering:**
- Chart updates instantly when any filter is changed
- Table data syncs with chart filters
- Statistics recalculate based on filtered data

#### **Patient Context:**
- When accessed via patient card click, shows patient info banner
- Patient name and details displayed at top of page
- "Back to Dashboard" button for easy navigation
- Page title updates to show patient name

## Technical Implementation

### **Data Flow:**
```
Patient Card Click → Router State (patientId) → Details Page → Filter Data → Chart + Table
```

### **Filtering Logic:**
1. **Patient Filter**: (Ready for real data) Filter by patientId when available
2. **Date Range**: Filter entries between startDate and endDate
3. **Symptom Selection**: Show only selected symptom types
4. **Severity Range**: Filter by severity level (0=relieved, 4=very severe)

### **Chart Data Transformation:**
- Raw symptom entries → Grouped by date → Chart data points
- Handles missing dates gracefully
- Supports multiple symptoms on same chart
- Color-coded lines for different symptoms

## Current State

### **Mock Data:**
- 28 symptom entries spanning 15 days (Jan 15-30, 2024)
- Covers both fever and pain symptoms
- Various severity levels and medications
- Realistic progression from severe to relieved

### **Patient Context:**
- Mock patient data for demonstration
- Patient info banner shows when accessed via card click
- Ready for real patient API integration

### **Features Working:**
- ✅ Interactive line chart with SVG
- ✅ Date range filtering
- ✅ Symptom multi-select
- ✅ Severity range slider
- ✅ Real-time data updates
- ✅ Statistics dashboard
- ✅ Data table with filtered results
- ✅ CSV export functionality
- ✅ Patient context display
- ✅ Navigation integration

## Usage

### **Access Methods:**
1. **Via Patient Card**: Click any patient card on main dashboard
2. **Direct Navigation**: Go to `/dashboard/details` (shows general analysis)
3. **Symptom Analysis Button**: Click button on main dashboard

### **Using the Chart:**
1. **Select Date Range**: Use From/To date pickers
2. **Choose Symptoms**: Select from dropdown (Fever, Pain)
3. **Adjust Severity**: Use slider to filter by severity levels
4. **View Results**: Chart and table update automatically
5. **Export Data**: Click "Download Report" for CSV export

### **Patient-Specific Analysis:**
- When accessed via patient card, shows that patient's context
- All filtering applies to the selected patient's data
- Patient info displayed prominently
- Easy return to main dashboard

## Future Enhancements

### **Real Data Integration:**
- Replace mock data with actual patient symptom entries
- Add patientId field to symptom entries
- Implement patient-specific data filtering
- Connect to real patient API

### **Additional Features:**
- More symptom types
- Medication effectiveness analysis
- Trend predictions
- Comparative analysis between patients
- Export to PDF reports
- Email sharing capabilities

The chart is now properly integrated as a patient-specific analysis tool rather than a standalone demo, making it much more practical and contextual for healthcare professionals.
